  - [x] When clicking on a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for **more than 6 stars**) the video should be played immediately.
    - *NOTE: I change the criteria from 5 stars to 6 stars because the ratings for the movies I extracted are all above 5 stars.*
  - [x] Less popular videos rely on the detailed page should show an image preview that can initiate playing a YouTube video.
- [ ] Add a play icon overlay to popular movies to indicate that the movie can be played (1 point).
- [ ] Apply data binding for views to help remove boilerplate code. (1 point)

### Notes
It was challenging to understand where to put data binding since we have a MovieAdapter and a MainActivity. The example provided inflate values in MainActivity, but for our project we inflate and change their values in MovieAdapter, so that took me a while to figure out.

- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.
